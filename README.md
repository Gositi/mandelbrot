# mandelbrot
A mandelbrot renderer written in C.
I have not had more time to fill this README in, but you can change the neccessary settings using the `config.py` script.
To convert the outputted `mandel.bmp` image, run `convert.py` with the new filename as argument.
The compiled code is for 64-bit linux (successfully ran on later versions of Ubuntu).
